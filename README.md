# Tool Trivia

## Description

Tool Trivia challenges developers to identify a tool only by looking at the reasons people use them. The hope is that it will challenge players' assumptions about tools or, at the very least, introduce them to new ones.

## Requirements
- Python 2.7.1
- Django 1.9.6
- gunicorn 19.3
- dj-database-url 0.3.0
- whitenoise 2.0.2
- requests

# Future Features
- Randomly choose a category for each game, and only display tools that fit in it. That should make it harder for players to tell which reasons belong to which tool.
- Update to use class-based views, which is the Modern Django Wayâ„¢.
